### Use zarf to login to the needed registries i.e. registry1.dso.mil

```bash
# Download Zarf
make build/zarf

# Login to the registry
set +o history

# registry1.dso.mil (To access registry1 images needed during build time)
export REGISTRY1_USERNAME="YOUR-USERNAME-HERE"
export REGISTRY1_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
echo $REGISTRY1_TOKEN | build/zarf tools registry login registry1.dso.mil --username $REGISTRY1_USERNAME --password-stdin

set -o history
```

### Build and Deploy Everything via Makefile and local package

```bash
# This will run make build/all, make cluster/reset, and make deploy/all. Follow the breadcrumbs in the Makefile to see what and how its doing it.
make all
```
